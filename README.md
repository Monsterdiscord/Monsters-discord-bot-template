# Discord Py Bot Template

Discord.py is a library that allows you to make discord bots with python and this repo is a template of a bot which is made by using Discord.Py.
- ✨I am trying to help the bot developing community with this template✨

## Features

- 5+ ready to use functions.
- Easy start for begginer bot developers.

## Notes From The Developer
> It is recommended to use other sources to get started with the bot developement process and use this repo to take a look when you strugle or when you need to see a finished bot structure.

> The code written in this project was in my very early times of coding so don't rely on its organization and code layout.

> I will be releasing a comprehensive update about the file organization and clean code when i have the time for it.
